Hello!

You can install dependencies with `composer install` and the tests can be run from the root with `./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests --testdox`

Not all classes are fully tested and there is room for improvement but I hope this shows clean and readable code, sensible structure, reasonable separation of concerns and some decent tests for the core functionality.
